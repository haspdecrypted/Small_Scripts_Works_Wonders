To delete a pandas groupby object in Python, you simply need to remove any references to it, and the object will be garbage collected by Python's memory management. Here's an example to illustrate this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Group': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'Group'
grouped = df.groupby('Group')

# Perform some operations on the grouped data
mean_values = grouped.mean()
print(mean_values)

# Now, to delete the groupby object, remove the reference to it
del grouped

# You can no longer access the groupby object
# The object will be garbage collected by Python
# You can check that it is deleted by trying to access it
# This will raise an error
try:
    print(grouped)
except NameError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

In this example, we create a DataFrame `df` and group it by the 'Group' column to create a groupby object `grouped`. We then perform some operations on the grouped data, calculating the mean values. Finally, we delete the reference to `grouped` using `del grouped`. Attempting to access `grouped` after deletion will raise a `NameError`, confirming that the object has been deleted.
