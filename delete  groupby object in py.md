To delete a pandas groupby object in Python, you simply need to remove any references to it, and the object will be garbage collected by Python's memory management. Here's an example to illustrate this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Group': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'Group'
grouped = df.groupby('Group')

# Perform some operations on the grouped data
mean_values = grouped.mean()
print(mean_values)

# Now, to delete the groupby object, remove the reference to it
del grouped

# You can no longer access the groupby object
# The object will be garbage collected by Python
# You can check that it is deleted by trying to access it
# This will raise an error
try:
    print(grouped)
except NameError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

In this example, we create a DataFrame `df` and group it by the 'Group' column to create a groupby object `grouped`. We then perform some operations on the grouped data, calculating the mean values. Finally, we delete the reference to `grouped` using `del grouped`. Attempting to access `grouped` after deletion will raise a `NameError`, confirming that the object has been deleted.

<h3> delete single record by record from group by</h3>
If you want to delete a single record from a specific group in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `groupby()` function to create groups and then apply different operations to each group. To delete a specific record from a group, you can use the `drop()` function. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Group': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'Group'
grouped = df.groupby('Group')

# Delete a specific record from a group
group_name = 'A'  # Specify the group name
record_to_delete = 3  # Specify the record value

# Filter the group and drop the record
grouped_filtered = grouped.get_group(group_name).drop(
    grouped.get_group(group_name)[grouped.get_group(group_name)['Value'] == record_to_delete].index
)

# Print the updated group
print(grouped_filtered)
```

In this example, we have a DataFrame `df` with two columns, 'Group' and 'Value'. We want to delete a specific record from group 'A', where the 'Value' is 3. 

We use the `groupby()` function to create groups based on the 'Group' column, and then we filter the group with the specified name using `get_group()`. We use the `drop()` function to remove the record from the filtered group by passing the index of the record we want to delete.

Finally, we print the updated group `grouped_filtered`, which will not contain the specified record.

For Example:

Certainly! Here's an example of how you can modify your data and implement the same logic to delete a record from a group:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Modify the data
data = [
    {"name": "Ramesh", "age": "24", "company": "abc"},
    {"name": "Suresh", "age": "27", "company": "abc"}
]

# Create a DataFrame from the modified data
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'company'
grouped = df.groupby('company')

# Delete a specific record from a group
group_name = 'abc'  # Specify the group name
record_to_delete = 'Suresh'  # Specify the record name

# Filter the group and drop the record
grouped_filtered = grouped.get_group(group_name).drop(
    grouped.get_group(group_name)[grouped.get_group(group_name)['name'] == record_to_delete].index
)

# Print the updated group
print(grouped_filtered)
```

In this example, we have modified the data to a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a record. We then create a DataFrame `df` from the modified data.

Next, we group the DataFrame by the 'company' column using `groupby()`. We specify the group name as 'abc' and the record to delete as 'Suresh'.

We filter the group using `get_group()` and then drop the record from the filtered group using `drop()` and passing the index of the record to delete.

Finally, we print the updated group `grouped_filtered`, which will no longer contain the specified record.

<h3>Updated for same datatype</h3>

Apologies for the confusion. If you want to keep the data type of `grouped_filtered` the same as `grouped`, you can use the `filter()` function instead of `drop()`. The `filter()` function retains the rows that satisfy a given condition. Here's the modified code:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Modify the data
data = [
    {"name": "shubham", "age": "24", "company": "accenture"},
    {"name": "arijit", "age": "27", "company": "accenture"}
]

# Create a DataFrame from the modified data
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'company'
grouped = df.groupby('company')

# Delete a specific record from a group
group_name = 'accenture'  # Specify the group name
record_to_delete = 'arijit'  # Specify the record name

# Define a filter function
def filter_group(group):
    return group[group['name'] != record_to_delete]

# Apply the filter function to the group
grouped_filtered = grouped.apply(filter_group)

# Remove the grouping index from the resulting DataFrame
grouped_filtered.reset_index(drop=True, inplace=True)

# Print the updated group
print(grouped_filtered)
```

In this updated code, the `filter_group()` function takes a group as input and applies the filter condition to retain only the rows where the name is not equal to the record you want to delete.

We use the `apply()` function to apply the `filter_group()` function to each group in `grouped`, resulting in a new DataFrame `grouped_filtered` that retains the original group structure.

Finally, we use `reset_index()` to remove the grouping index from `grouped_filtered` and print the updated group. Now, `grouped_filtered` will have the same data type as `grouped`.
