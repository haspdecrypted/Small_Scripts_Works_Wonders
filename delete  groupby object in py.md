To delete a pandas groupby object in Python, you simply need to remove any references to it, and the object will be garbage collected by Python's memory management. Here's an example to illustrate this:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Group': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'Group'
grouped = df.groupby('Group')

# Perform some operations on the grouped data
mean_values = grouped.mean()
print(mean_values)

# Now, to delete the groupby object, remove the reference to it
del grouped

# You can no longer access the groupby object
# The object will be garbage collected by Python
# You can check that it is deleted by trying to access it
# This will raise an error
try:
    print(grouped)
except NameError as e:
    print("Error:", e)
```

In this example, we create a DataFrame `df` and group it by the 'Group' column to create a groupby object `grouped`. We then perform some operations on the grouped data, calculating the mean values. Finally, we delete the reference to `grouped` using `del grouped`. Attempting to access `grouped` after deletion will raise a `NameError`, confirming that the object has been deleted.

If you want to delete a single record from a specific group in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `groupby()` function to create groups and then apply different operations to each group. To delete a specific record from a group, you can use the `drop()` function. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a sample DataFrame
data = {'Group': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
        'Value': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Group the DataFrame by 'Group'
grouped = df.groupby('Group')

# Delete a specific record from a group
group_name = 'A'  # Specify the group name
record_to_delete = 3  # Specify the record value

# Filter the group and drop the record
grouped_filtered = grouped.get_group(group_name).drop(
    grouped.get_group(group_name)[grouped.get_group(group_name)['Value'] == record_to_delete].index
)

# Print the updated group
print(grouped_filtered)
```

In this example, we have a DataFrame `df` with two columns, 'Group' and 'Value'. We want to delete a specific record from group 'A', where the 'Value' is 3. 

We use the `groupby()` function to create groups based on the 'Group' column, and then we filter the group with the specified name using `get_group()`. We use the `drop()` function to remove the record from the filtered group by passing the index of the record we want to delete.

Finally, we print the updated group `grouped_filtered`, which will not contain the specified record.
