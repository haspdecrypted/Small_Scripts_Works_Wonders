To run a Java class file named `Test.java` using the `./gradlew` command (Gradle wrapper), you'll need to create a custom Gradle task to execute that class. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `build.gradle` file if it's not already open.

2. Add the following code to define a new task for running your `Test` class:

```gradle
task runTest(type: JavaExec) {
    main = 'Test' // Replace with the name of your Java class (without the .java extension)
    classpath = sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath
}
```

Make sure to replace `'Test'` with the name of your Java class (without the `.java` extension). If your `Test.java` file is in a specific package, you should provide the fully qualified class name (e.g., `'com.example.Test'`).

3. Save the `build.gradle` file.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your project.

5. Run the following command to execute your `Test` class using the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`):

```shell
./gradlew runTest
```

This command will compile and run your `Test` class using the Gradle wrapper script. Ensure that your `Test.java` class is in the correct package (if applicable) and that the classpath is correctly configured in the `build.gradle` file.

Remember to replace `'Test'` with the actual name of your Java class, and make sure that the necessary dependencies are configured in your Gradle build file if your class relies on external libraries.
